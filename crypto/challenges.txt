spy
Damn, we cant crack the enemy's morning report! The enemy found out that their cryptographic protocols are compromised and doubled the encryption. Can you crack their new encryption scheme?

leakeyd
We managed to capture one of the enemy spies and get their keypair! It seems that each spy uses a different exponent though, can you still read their messages?


suspicious signing
Our agents have gained access to a signing server that the enemy spies used to sign their messages. I wonder if you can use it to decrypt the secret information?


Weak RSA
A rogue employe managed to steal a file from his work computer, he encrypted the file with RSA before he got apprehended. We only managed to recover the public key, can you help us decrypt this ciphertext?
